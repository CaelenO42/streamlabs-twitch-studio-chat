## Description

Twitch Studio has a built in Chatbox that has a really nice styling to it, but is only usable with Twich Studio, which is limited compared to things like OBS. This is my attempt at recreating, to the best of my ability, this styling for use with StreamLabs' Chatbox.

## Usage

1. Go to Streamlabs' Chatbox Settings or click [here](https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/chatbox)
2. Scroll Down and change `Enable Custom HTML/CSS` to `Enabled`
3. Copy and Paste the code from GitHub into the respective fields on Streamlabs
4. Enjoy
